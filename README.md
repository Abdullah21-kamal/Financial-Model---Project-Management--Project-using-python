# Financial-Model---Project-Management--Project-using-python

Project Description:
1- A new biopharmaceutical company wants to produce an algea-based supplement but have a 
challenge of calculating the capital budgeting for the production machines. We are trying to 
build a model that is able to calculate the number of machines needed to invest in and the 
advertising budget as well in order to produce and sell the supplement. Each production line 
manufactures (N_Supp) per year. Each Supplement unit sells for (R_Supp) and costs a variable 
cost of (C_Supp) per unit to produce. Each year there is a depreciation of the assets by a 
percentage of (D_Machine) until it can no longer produces units. At that time, the machines 
can be scrapped by a value of (P_Machine).
In order to manage the capital, you need to either invest in the machineâ€™s procurement or the 
supplement advertising on year basis. In the first year you need to invest in the procurement.
The demand for the supplement is affected by the advertising, it begins with value (d_Supp) 
and every year if invested in advertising it increases with a percentage (p_Demand) in a market 
interest rate of (r_Market).

2- -The application enables the user to:
 - Compute Net present Value
 - Build cash flow model as transacted per year based on all cost, production, 
demand, investment variables.
 - Determine the (N_Supp) number of supplements demanded per year based 
on the marketing budgets

3- The project is implemented into two different forms; the fist way is to use the command window to deal with the program to run and to enter inputs and see results 
  the other way is to just enter a csv file that contains all or the required inputs to run the progeam and it will run as needed
 
  

4- After the excution of the program, for each output we need to see its growth will have a pop graph over the interval time determined firstly.
all of outputs will be recorded into xlsx files in the location of the project.
